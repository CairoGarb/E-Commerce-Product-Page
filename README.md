# E-Commerce Product Page

This is a simple page for a product of an E-Commerce. 

## How it works

There is a few interactive elements:
- The navigation bar and the profile avatar in header only have a hovering interaction.
- The cart icon also has an interaction. When clicked, it opens the cart and shows the products (if has any), price and quantity aswell. Also contains a "Chekout" button and a trash can icon, both of which perform the same function (clear the cart).
- Images of the product can be changed and it also opens a image galery if you click on the larger image (desktop only).
- There is a "quantity" button, who is self explanatoy, increases/decreases the quantity.
- Add To Cart button is also self explanatory, where it adds the product and the chosen quantity to the cart.

Mobile Version:
- Menu bar in the Header, where the nav opens.
- The images can be changed with the arrows, the gallery doesn't work on mobiles.
